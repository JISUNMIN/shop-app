/*
  Warnings:

  - The `description` column on the `products` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The `category` column on the `products` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `name` on the `products` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
